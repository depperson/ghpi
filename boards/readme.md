Both of these board designs have been manufactured by OSH Park, assembled and tested by myself. 


# GreenhousePi board (ghpi-board-r4.zip) 
This attaches four 1-wire networks, a Nordic RF24, and an I2C OLED display to a Raspberry Pi GPIO port. 
BOM:
- 6x 2p 3.5mm screw terminals
- 1x 2p 5mm screw terminals
- 1x Raspberry Pi GPIO female connector (2x18)
- 2x 4.7k 1/4w resistors
- 2x 10k 1/4w resistors
- 3x 4p .100 female row header


# RF24Remote board (rf24remote-board-r3.zip)
This attaches two 1-wire networks and a Nortic RF24 to an Arduino Pro Micro 3.3v microcontroller. This package transmits temperature readings to the GreenhousePi board. 

BOM:
- 2x 4p .100 female row header
- 3x 2p 3.5mm screw terminals
- 1x 2p 5mm screw terminals
- 2x 4.7k 1/4w resistors
- 1x Arduino Pro Micro 3.3v
